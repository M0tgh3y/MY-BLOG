                Someone said they left together<br> 
                I ran out the door to get her<br> 
                She was holding hands with Trevor<br> 
                Not the greatest feeling ever<br> 
                Said, "Pull yourself together<br> 
                You should try your luck with Heather"<br> 
                Then I heard they slept together<br> 
                Oh, the less I know the better<br> 
                The less I know the better<br> 
                Oh, my love, can't you see yourself by my side?<br> 
                No surprise when you're on his shoulder like every night<br> 
                Oh, my love, can't you see that you're on my mind?<br> 
                Don't suppose you could convince your lover to change his mind?<br> 
                So goodbye<br> 
                She said, "It's not now or never<br> 
                Wait ten years, we'll be together"<br> 
                I said, "Better late than never<br> 
                Just don't make me wait forever"<br> 
                Don't make me wait forever<br> 
                Don't make me wait forever<br> 
                Oh, my love, can't you see yourself by my side?<br> 
                I don't suppose you could convince your lover to change his mind?<br> 
                I was doin' fine without you<br> 
                'Til I saw your face, now I can't erase<br> 
                Givin' in to all his bullshit<br> 
                Is this what you want? is this who you are?<br> 
                I was doin' fine without you<br> 
                'Til I saw your eyes turn away from mine<br> 
                Oh, sweet darling, where he wants you<br> 
                Said, "Come on Superman, say your stupid line"<br> 
                Said, "Come on Superman, say your stupid line"<br> 
                Said, "Come on Superman, say your stupid line"<br>
