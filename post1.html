                Someone said they left together, I ran out the door to get her, She was holding hands with Trevor<br> 
                Not the greatest feeling ever, Said, "Pull yourself together, You should try your luck with Heather"<br> 
                Then I heard they slept together, Oh, the less I know the better, The less I know the better<br> 
                Oh, my love, can't you see yourself by my side?, No surprise when you're on his shoulder like every night<br> 
                Oh, my love, can't you see that you're on my mind?, Don't suppose you could convince your lover to change his mind?<br> 
                So goodbye, She said, "It's not now or never, Wait ten years, we'll be together"<br> 
                I said, "Better late than never, Just don't make me wait forever"<br> 
                Don't make me wait forever<br> 
                Don't make me wait forever<br> 
                Oh, my love, can't you see yourself by my side?, I don't suppose you could convince your lover to change his mind?<br> 
                I was doin' fine without you, 'Til I saw your face, now I can't erase<br> 
                Givin' in to all his bullshit, Is this what you want? is this who you are?, I was doin' fine without you<br> 
                'Til I saw your eyes turn away from mine, Oh, sweet darling, where he wants you<br> 
                Said, "Come on Superman, say your stupid line"<br> 
                Said, "Come on Superman, say your stupid line"<br> 
                Said, "Come on Superman, say your stupid line"<br>
